@page mdbDir List of data in a database directory.

@section dir-description DESCRIPTION

The m17n library loads a list of definitions of data of the m17n
database from files of name "mdb.dir" in each database directory at
initialization time.  The plist format of this file is as follows:

@verbatim
MDB-DIR ::= DEFINITION *

DEFINITION ::= '(' TAG0 [ TAG1 [ TAG2 [ TAG3 ] ] ] FILE ')'

TAGn ::= SYMBOL

FILE ::= MTEXT
@endverbatim

If TAG0 is neither `charset' nor `char-table', and TAGn (n > 0) is a
symbol `*', FILE can contain a wildcard charater, and all files
matching FILE accoding to the rules used by the shell are the target
of database files.  In that case, each file must contain a plist
element providing the actual TAGn values by the form:

@verbatim
'(' TAG0 TAG1 TAG2 TAG3 ')'
@endverbatim

For instance, if a database directory contains these files:

@verbatim
zh-py.mim:
(input-method zh py)
...

ko-han2.mim:
(input-method ko han2)
...
@endverbatim

these lines in "mdb.dir":

@verbatim
(input-method zh py "zh-py.mim")
(input-method ko han2 "ko-han2.mim")
@endverbatim

can be shortened to this single line:

@verbatim
(input-method * "*.mim")
@endverbatim
