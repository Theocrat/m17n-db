(description "Provide utilities for CJK input methods.
This is acutually not a standalone input method, but is expected
to be included in the other input method (e.g. zh-py).

The fullwidth mode is turned on by typing \">>\", and turned off
by typing \"<<\".

The single fullwidth mode is turned on by typing \"Z\".  In this
mode, any key typed is converted to the fullwidth character and
is inserted, then the mode is turned off.
